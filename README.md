# EC2 Weekend Start/Stop activity Automated System

## Overview
This project automates EC2 instance management based on **Snoozing Tags** using AWS Lambda functions. It ensures seamless automation of instance start/stop operations while maintaining a detailed log of all changes in Amazon S3.
It will store the state of all the instances in the S3 Bucket.
It will start all the instances which were in stopped state and which Snoozing TAGs value is "Yes/No/NA/NULL/ ". This start funtion remove all the Values of Snoozing and kept it "". So that server should start the ec2 instances.
Last Restored funtion will restored all the changes which were made by the start funtion as well as it restore the tags value of those ec2 instances.


##  Architecture
The solution consists of three AWS Lambda functions:
1. **Backup EC2 State** â†’ Captures the current state of EC2 instances and stores the details in an S3 `.CSV` file.
2. **Start EC2 Instances** â†’ Checks `Snoozing` tag values and starts instances accordingly while resetting the Snoozing tag value. It doesn't touch the running instances and their tags.
3. **Stop EC2 Instances & Revert Tags** â†’ Stops only instances started during execution and restores Snoozing tags to their original values.

### **ðŸ›  Services Used**
- **AWS Lambda** â†’ Executes automation workflows. We require three Lambda funtion for this.
- **Amazon S3** â†’ Stores `.CSV` logs of instance states. We require a S3 bucket which stores all the .CSV files in it.
- **Amazon EC2** â†’ Manages compute instances. 
- **AWS EventBridge** â†’ Triggers automation at scheduled intervals. In this project we require three EventBridge which will trigger Lambda funtion one after one.
- **IAM Roles** â†’ Provides Lambda access to EC2 & S3.

## CSV File Structure
Each `.CSV` file maintains logs of changes at different stages of execution.

### **Backup Log (`backup_ec2_state_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`)**
| Instance ID | Instance Name | Previous State | Snoozing Tag |
|------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| i-1234567890abcd | WebServer-01 | Stopped | Yes |

### **Start Log (`started_servers_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`)**
| Instance ID | Instance Name | Previous State | Previous Snoozing Tag | New State | New Snoozing Tag |
|------------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|------------|-----------------|
| i-1234567890abcd | WebServer-01 | Stopped | Yes | Started | "" |

### **Stop Log (`restored_servers_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`)**
| Instance ID | Instance Name | Previous State | Previous Snoozing Tag | New Snoozing Tag | Current State | Restored Snoozing Tag |
|------------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|------------------|
| i-1234567890abcd | WebServer-01 | Running | Yes | "" | Stopped | Yes |

##  Deployment Steps
To deploy this automation in your AWS environment:
1. **Set Up IAM Role Permissions**
   - Grant Lambda permission to **manage EC2 instances**, **read/write to S3**, and **modify tags**.
2. **Deploy Lambda Functions**
   - Upload each function into the AWS Lambda console.
   - Set environment variables for S3 bucket names and execution settings.
3. **Schedule with EventBridge**
   - Define a recurring schedule for **weekly executions** to automate management.
4. **Verify S3 Logs**
   - Ensure logs are stored correctly in S3 for review.
